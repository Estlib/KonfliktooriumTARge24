                <h2>Step 1: Creating the Hole and Adding a Screw or Anchor</h2>
                <p>Use masking tape to mark the correct depth on your bit. 
                    If you need your hole to be a particular depth (e.g., if you’re installing a screw or anchor of a certain length), 
                    measure off the appropriate length on your bit. Mark the depth by wrapping a thin strip of masking tape around the drill bit.

                <p>Drilling can produce a lot of dust and debris. To protect your eyes, nose, and lungs, it’s important to wear proper safety equipment.</p>

                <p>When you’re ready to start, position the tip of the drill on the point where you’d like to create your hole. 
                    Make sure the bit is level and positioned at a 90° angle relative to the wall. Squeeze the trigger gently to begin turning the bit.

                    If you stop the drill before you try to pull it out, you may break the bit

                <p>If you’re installing a plug or anchor in your drill hole, carefully tap it into the hole with a rubber mallet. 
                    Make sure the anchor is securely in place before you install a hook or screw in the hole.
